Version 0.0.4
Updated 6/16/22
-Variety of bug fixes:
   -Game will no longer crash when changing category before the initial scan
   -Electric poles now correctly say connected based on cursor location, not player location
   -Belts that become invalid should no longer crash the game
   -Oddly shaped buildings should now read all input/output regardless of orientation
-Brand new movement modes brought by @Eph on Discord.  Toggle between them with Control+W
   -Telestep: The good old movement you all know and try to love
   -Step-By-Walk: Should be the same as telestep but with footstep sound effects.  
   -Smooth-Walking: Effectively turns off the read tile system unless you walk into something you cannot pass through.  Great for navigating forests, squeezing between furnaces, and getting places quickly.  No more angry tapping.
Note: The new movement system may have some undiscovered bugs, so please be patient and report in the Issues channel on Discord.
-Significant improvements to scanning and initialization performance.
-A fresh new .jkm file for Jaws users.  This should also speed up performance.  Consult the readme for instructions on how to install this file.

Version 0.0.2
Updated 6/15/22
-Started a changelog, version numbers will be reflected here but not in the mods folder just to keep things simple
-Added tile based descriptions of a buildings input/output.  To see this information, use cursor mode and move around the perimeter of the building.  
   For instance: moving the cursor over the top left corner of a burner mining drill will speak "output 1 north" indicating that things come out of the building, and this occurs 1 tile north of the cursor.
-Added descriptions for direction a building is facing
--Added power output description when cursor is over a generator type building
   note: solar panels are programmed differently, so will require more work for power output information.
-Added total network power production to description when cursor is on electric poles
-Added several new categories for scanning
-Empty categories will now be ignored, and the player will not have to move through them.
-Added a Jump to Scanned feature, whereby the player can jump their cursor to the location of something in the scan list.
   This is done with control+home and can only be done while in cursor mode
-Underground belts and pipes are now somewhat accessible.  Once placed they will indicate the location of their connected partner. 
   Note, these objects do not yet speak "connected" or "not connected" while placing them, but that too will be added this week.
-Modified building logic to be more reliable.
-Building from cursor now supported.  Player must be in range of the target location, and the target location must be unoccupied
-Removed unnecessary empty inventories from buildings
-Callibration once again has a failsafe.  If your callibration failed, you will be prompted to callibrate again.
-Player will now be notified at the end of every autosave, and at the beginning of any autosave triggered by pressing F1
   Note: Notifying at the start of game triggered autosaves is a work in progress, and should be done by end of week.
-Fixed crash triggered by selecting "back" option in launcher save file list
