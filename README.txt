Mod Controls:
Movement:  W A S D
note: When you change direction, your character doesn't immediately move a tile in that direction.  Think of it like turning your head before taking a step.
Change movement mode: CONTROL + W
Note the 3 movement types are as follows:
   1- Telestep: Press a direction to turn in that direction, then continue pressing in that direction to move
   2- Step-By-Walk:  This mode is similar to Telestep, however the player character will physically take steps in the direction chosen.  The biggest difference is footsteps.
   3- Smooth-Walking: In this mode the character will move similarly to in a sighted game.  The player will be notified if they run into something, but otherwise will not be notified of entities they are passing.  Very fast, and great for getting around!
